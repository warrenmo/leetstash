# LeetGPU

[LeetGPU](https://leetgpu.com/) is a site where users can practice GPU programming puzzles,
in a similar vein to [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com).

Conveniently, LeetGPU takes care of spinning up a GPU (of your limited choice) on your behalf,
so you don't have to worry about setting up a "hardware-accelerated cloud environment" yourself.


Google Colab, eat your heart out.
